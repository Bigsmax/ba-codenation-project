        1.1 Describe the purpose of IT in modern business.
        <br>
        <br>
        Information Technology helps modern businesses in a number of ways.  
        Industries and companies ranging from small sole traders to large blue chip organisations 
        rely on technology in so many different ways. 
        In general the benefits of incorporating IT in business include: 
        improved communication, optimizing production and productivity.
        In additon IT helps businesses with inventory management and supports most financial record keeping.

        1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
        successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
        <br>
        <br>
        The first steps in the delivery of successful digital projects should involve scoping and evaluating 
        all options, creating detailed plans, and engaging creative teams to begin the back/front-end development 
        of the final product. Subsequent steps would involve testing and quality assessment to ensure requirements 
        and specifications have been implemented successfully before project is delivered. Managing digital projects 
        from concept to completion require acute project management skills. Appointing a project manager would help 
        safeguard deliverables and ensure project are completed and handed over on time and on budget. The skills required 
        could include strong communication skills, being able to manage cross-functional teams, alongside the ability to simplify 
        complex workflows, and give/receive feedback would secure the successful delivery of projects.
        <br>
        <br>
        Cloud-based project management systems and team collaboration tools are key assets to have in place to support any digital project.  
        They help facilitate transparent communication between team members, executive stakeholders, and external collaborators in the planning, 
        negotiation, tracking, and measurement of project outcomes in real time.

        1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?
        Include a link to your Trello board.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would begin by setting a purpose and goal for the site. I would scope out websites I like 
        the look of, exploring the fonts, layouts, colours co-ordinations and features on the site. I would explore software options CMS/HTML 
        If graphics are needed for the site and if the desired outcome were beyond my technical ability I would assign roles to graphic designers, 
        web designer or developer. I would determine the functionality I want the site to have, and create a content strategy towards that. I would 
        use Trello to build the structure and map out a flowchart. Following this I would begin designing and creating a mock-up site, test it out and 
        then ensure it is ready to be delivered.
        <br>
        <br>
        Please see the Trello board I created for the planning out of this website here &rarr; <a href="https://trello.com/b/3ocRdJ5d/codenation-independent-project" target="_blank">Trello</a>

        1.4 - Describe the ristks that might impact digital projects - 
        what casues digital projects to fail? Why?
        <br>
        <br>
        Risks that could impact digital projects include, lack of scoping, poorly defined, strategy / vision unclear, internal resistance between teams and organisations, 
        not enough investment in technology, poor vendor selection, and vendor lock-in. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Mainstream companies are more likely to suffer from unclear strategy, poor on-going 
        measurement and lack of alignment in the team. Very often larger tech companies fail to deliver projects due to vendor locking.  This is when the cost of switching 
        to a different vendor is so high that the customer is essentially stuck with the original vendor and “locked in" to what may be an inferior product or service.
        A real-world example of vendor lock-in is in cloud based computing, where software or computing infrastructure is outsourced to cloud vendors, who offers it as a service 
        and delivers it over the Internet. The issue with vendor lock-in is the difficulty in moving to another cloud service provider if something goes awry.

        1.5 - Describe about how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software
        - how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
        <br>
        <br>
        The market is filled with so many different IT systems and software options. There is not a one size fits all model for IT systems and software. I would make selections on a case-by-case basis. 
        Selection of tools and resources should identify the needs and requirement for the job. I would explore the market and look for alternatives; conducts test-drives and evaluate 
        them against the needs of the project. I would also evaluate costs and measure against the available budget.

    <p class="div8">
        1.6 - Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you
        achieve your outcomes - How has Trell helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your 
        version control.
        <br>
        <br>
        All the tools I used during the course helped me gain more independence working on digital projects. Zoom, Trello, Github, VS code, Python, Repl.it and Slack opened new pathways and opportunities 
        for me and showed me what technology can do for me and how creative I can be within that. Something I could not see before. Trello helped me focus projects, and Python and GitHub introduced me to how 
        to get ideas out into the virtual environment. Having the real time experience of using the tools as part of a working team has helped me develop greater confidence in sharing and developing work online. 
        Now, I feel that I can set new goals for myself and have the appropriate tools to start to work towards them.

        1.7 - Describe leagl guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects - 
        How does GDPR impact digital projects?
        <br>
        <br>
        The UK Government has put in place tough new measures to ensure the UK is the safest place in the world to be online. Independent 
        regulators have been appointed to enforce new standards and to ensure that digital media companies meet their responsibilities accordingly. 
        The laws in place apply to any digital media & tech company that allows its users to share or discover user generated content or interact with each other online. 
        This means wide ranges of companies of all sizes are in scope, including social media platforms, file hosting sites, advertising agencies, public discussion forums, messaging services, and search engines. 
        GDPR regulations have been modified according to government regulations. As an example, code of practice prevents any media firm from using behavioural advertising. Under existing legislation (the GDPR and PECR) 
        user consent is already needed before behavioural advertising can take place. The GDPR code particularly focuses on areas pertaining to child users, or all users if age is not established.
