        2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed 
        in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? 
        E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
        <br>
        <br>
        Python helped me develop the site along with learning about HTML and CSS and the differences between them both. In general I found Python easy to read, it took me a while and I have to be more patient and practice more.
        It seems like a very versatile program and has a productive coding environment. Due to it being an open source and community-based program, there are countless like-minded developers and programmers who work with the language 
        on a daily basis and offer so much insight to the features. Moving forwards I sure I will create more through both this and along with VS Code. Having come from a theatre background I am always mapping and managing projects. 
        Trello was a great discovery for me, it enabled me to transfer the skills I have in narrative storytelling and prioritise workflow. It’s a solid tool for managing the workflow and I will certainly be using it moving forward. 
        I can see how useful this tool can be in larger teams.
        <br>
        <br>
        Prior to the course I had never heard of VS code, Python Kanban apps. Downloading for me was a nerve-wracking experience.  I expected that though. VS Code is from Microsoft, it may cause a problem for me working on my Mac. However, 
        it just worked, the integrations with Python and CSS coding was relatively easy to control and navigate. At first I found the font ligatures very confusing and took me some while to navigate the syntax.  The system is user friendly, 
        over the next few months I will enjoy learning more about the software and exploring it’s more advanced features

        2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate 
        E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello 
        <br>
        <br>
        The tools that were given to me to use for the duration of the course were easy to apply and supported the delivery of my assignments and projects. VS code helped support my coding practice and was easy to apply and follow. 
        Trello helped me with teamwork related tasks and creating task lists and schedules, as well as reporting task progression. File sharing with Repl.it helped with team exercises and drafting of code. Slack helped with the day-to-day 
        chat and project specific communication throughout the course as well as sharing and receiving code.  Draw.io was very god for fleshing out flowcharts and helped to bring ideas to life. Learning how to use these tools was a good experience.

        2.3 - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project
         are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review 
        it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
        <br>
        <br>
        Track record in creating theatre and storytelling and narrative structure was a strength I played on throughout the course. This helped balance out the gaps in my knowledge and expertise on using the coding software tools. I worked well with utilising the 
        resources that were provided and I worked them as best I could to my strengths where necessary. 
        I was not shy to address my weaknesses and I was quick to ask for support and sought help to bolster my project. I used every opportunity to ask for clarification. I found great support in the team I working with and was able to meet every challenge. 
        I failed to deliver both projects on the due date I d not see this as a threat or a negative as I wanted to be sure the projects were delivered at a high standard. In general I am very satisfied with the accomplishment on the website and in general am very 
        pleased that I have been able to produce my own website in a relatively short space of time.

        2.4 - Describe further improvements you can make to your project.
        <br>
        <br>
        Take more breaks and rest more than I had. I realised that I was not taking enough breaks and I was becoming increasingly impatience. I need to improve my proficiency in Python and CSS code. I also need improve on my team working skills and to be mindful, 
        patient and understanding with the entire cohort and in particular assigned team members. I want to work towards releasing the competitive aspect of my nature and to improve my communication skills and using code.

        2.5 - Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
        <br>
        <br>
        I have found that in a short space of time my productivity is more focused and have (through practice and research) identified the key resources, skills and methods I need to move forward in the industry.
