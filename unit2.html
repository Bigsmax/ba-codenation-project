        1.6 - Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face

        <br>
        <br>
        Websites that don't consider web accessibility for people with disabilities tend to miss out on a huge chunk of the market. Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed 
        and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (known as WCAG 2.1) are an internationally recognised set of recommendations 
        for improving web accessibility for users with impairments, including auditory - cognitive – neurological – physical  - speech, and visual impairments. 
        Recommendations to consider include: Use alt tags that clearly identify images, create subtitles and transcripts; this is particularly the case if the site is hosting videos (Hosting sites such as YouTube 
        have tools that allow users to add subtitles to their clips). It is also recommended to use periods in abbreviations to help readers comprehend abbreviated items, in addition writing out links, 
        rather just adding a click here link (underlining links etc.). Utilizing color control and avoid pairing colours that would be problematic for colour-blind users. Give clickable items a wider range to navigate around, 
        and keep website copy simple and include an accessibility guide.
