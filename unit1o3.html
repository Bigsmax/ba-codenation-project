        3.1 - Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – 
        could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
        <br>
        <br>
        In general context of both working as part of a team and on solo projects I feel it is helpful to Identify team talent and delegate tasks accordingly. 
        Not to be afraid to have other team members take care of certain jobs that I can’t do.  I think in developing websites it is crucial to explore more applications that help 
        communicate and collaborate more efficiently. Management of the IT tools and systems I was using could at times be tedious. I would avoid doing small tasks and focus much more on priority 
        tasks and ensure they are met first. This was certainly the case when I was building my website. Whilst working on my team project I had actually taken on quite a lot of the smaller jobs. 
        I tried to relieve the team I worked with by taking on the little jobs and this certainly helped with the delivery of assignments and projects.  However, in turn I need to focus on keeping 
        stand up meetings brief and focused on the key tasks and goals at hand. I realised that stand up meetings should not be used flesh out faults or problems within the team.

        3.2 - Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.
        <br>
        <br>
        Work less and take appropriate breaks. Explore cutting-edge technologies, frameworks and libraries. Limit the time spent working on developing skills on one tool, explore many more. 
        Be more flexible with working hours and work with larger teams online build communities and share work. Evaluate all software and third party technologies.

        3.3 - Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Teamwork? Use of Slack?
        <br>
        <br>
        Productivity is hard to measure in context of coding and working as a developer or programmer.  It would help to explore alternatives to Slack that would support the workload and increase communication and workload between teams in projects. 
        It would help to explore programs and extension apps that integrate well with Github, VS code and Python, (Code Tree, GloBoards, GitKraken, ESLint/TSLint, Code Spell Checker, Git Lens etc.).

        3.4 - Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.
        <br>
        <br>
        One of the major challenges in testing any digital project is to understanding which browsers and devices the target audience will be using. 
        It will also prove that the website is accessible across different device and browser types. There are a myriad of combinations and factors to consider. 
        I would conduct tests on hardware and or software emulators as well as breakdown data usage across devices and recommend storage required. I would also conduct multiple session log in’s, and test devices across different networks and devices 
        (4G, 5G Wi-Fi) ironing out potential risks of error messages, pop ups, pop out pages, and overlays.
